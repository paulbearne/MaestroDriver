Maestro Usb Pi application

Firstly we need to get the maestro devices to load winusb 

step 1 open powershell with administrator access (right click powershell run as administrator)
step 2 type
       net start WinRM<CR>    <CR> = carraige return key 
step 3 add your pi board to to windows trusts with the following replace xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx with the boards ip address
       Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx<CR>
       Hit enter to accept default option of Yes
step 4 connect to the board replacing the xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx with your ip address
       
	enter-PSSession -ComputerName xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -Credential Administrator<>
       
	enter your boards admin password if you haven't changed it the default is p@ssw0rd
       it will then connect to your pi may take a minute
step 5 make sure you have plugged your maestro board in then type
       devcon status 'USB\VID_1FFB*'<CR> 
 
	you should now see the info for your Maestro board something like this depending on which meastro your running

USB\VID_1FFB&PID_008A&MI_04\6&3B96929&0&0004
    Name: Pololu Mini Maestro 12-Channel USB Servo Controller
    The device has the following problem: 28			<------ note the device has a problem 
    Problem status: 0xC0000490
USB\VID_1FFB&PID_008A&MI_02\6&3B96929&0&0002
    Name: USB Serial Device
    Driver is running.
USB\VID_1FFB&PID_008A\00137654
    Name: USB Composite Device
    Driver is running.
USB\VID_1FFB&PID_008A&MI_00\6&3B96929&0&0000
    Name: USB Serial Device
    Driver is running.

to fix the problem an get winusb installed for the meastro device 
in windows file explorer type \\xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\c$ to open up your boards shared directory you will be prompted for the user and password 
user administrator password your boards administrator password default is p@ssw0rd

you will now see a list of directorys 
navigate to users\public         you can probably put them anywhere but seemed like a good place to put them
now copy the pololu.inf and pololu_usb_to_serial.inf to your board

now type cd \users\public<CR>
