# Pololu Maestro Usb Library

Uses usb control transfer functions to access most of the 
Maestro's functions 

Please read the readme file in the Instructions folder
first as it contains instructions and files needed to
get the library working correctly

Note this is still a work in progress and i will be adding 
more functionality over time.

Note you will need to download the Pololu SDK and 
add the bytecode.dll to your project referance.
